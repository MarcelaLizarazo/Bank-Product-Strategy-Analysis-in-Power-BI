# Bank Product Strategy Analysis in Power BI

## Project Overview

Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution based in Hyderabad, is exploring the introduction of a new line of credit cards to expand their product offerings and reach in the financial market. AtliQ Data Services has taken on a pilot project to analyze a sample dataset and provide key insights that will inform the bank's strategy for tailoring credit card products to customer needs and market trends.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis are to:

- Understand the demographic distribution of the bank's customers.
- Analyze income utilization across different customer segments.
- Investigate spending habits by category and payment type.
- Provide actionable insights on credit card usage and preferences.

## Data

The analysis is based on two CSV files containing sample data of 4000 customers across five cities:

1. `dim_customers`: Contains demographic information such as age group, occupation, and average income.
2. `fact_spends`: Includes detailed spending records by category, payment type, and month.

## Detailed Analysis

### Demographic Analysis

- **Gender Spending**: Men are outspending women across most categories, which may indicate a need for targeted marketing to balance the spending across genders.
- **Marital Status**: Married customers are spending more than single customers, particularly in categories such as Groceries and Health & Wellness, suggesting family-oriented spending habits.
- **Age Group**: The 25-45 age bracket shows the highest spending, indicating this group as the prime target for new credit card features and rewards programs.
- **City Insights**: Mumbai emerges as the city with the highest spending, which could be due to higher income levels or lifestyle choices. Tailored financial products for metropolitan areas could be a strategic focus.

### Income Utilization

- **Occupation-Based Spending**: Salaried IT Employees not only have higher average incomes but also higher income utilization percentages, signifying a potential market for premium credit card offerings.
- **Income vs. Spending**: There is a notable correlation between income levels and spending habits, with higher-income groups tending to spend more on Travel and Electronics.

### Spending Habits

- **Category Preferences**: Spending in Entertainment and Travel categories is significant, highlighting opportunities for partnerships with businesses in these sectors for co-branded credit cards.
- **Payment Method Trends**: Credit cards are not the dominant payment method across all categories, suggesting room for growth and the introduction of incentives to encourage credit card usage.

### Credit Card Analysis

- **Category Analysis**: The Travel and Entertainment categories see higher transactions on credit cards, indicating these as focal points for rewards or cashback offers.
- **Spend by City**: Different cities have varying preferences for credit card usage, with Mumbai showing a particularly high usage for larger transactions, suggesting targeted marketing initiatives.
- **Monthly Trends**: There's an upward trend in credit card spending over the months, with a notable peak in October, likely due to festive shopping, indicating the perfect timing for promotional offers.

## Insights and Enhanced Recommendations

The Power BI analysis has uncovered several actionable insights:

- **Salaried IT Employees**: This segment exhibits the highest spending levels and significant income utilization, indicating both the capacity and the tendency to use financial products extensively.
- **Essential Spending**: Expenditure in categories such as Groceries and Health & Wellness is prominent, suggesting that these areas are critical to the customers' monthly budgets.
- **Seasonal Spending**: There are discernible spikes in spending during certain months, which could correlate with festive seasons or holiday periods.
- **Travel Spend Insights**: The Travel category has shown substantial activity, which presents an opportunity for targeted credit card rewards.

**Enhanced Recommendations for Mitron Bank:**

1. **Targeted Credit Card Features**: Develop credit card features specifically for sectors with high spending, like IT employees, with benefits such as higher credit limits or specialized rewards programs.

2. **Strategic Merchant Partnerships**: Form partnerships with merchants in high-spend categories to offer exclusive discounts, cashback, or reward points for using Mitron Bank's credit cards.

3. **Seasonal Campaigns**: Capitalize on the increased spending during certain months by introducing promotional offers or increased rewards for spending in specific categories.

4. **Travel Rewards Program**: Given the notable spending in the travel category, consider launching a travel-focused credit card that offers benefits such as travel insurance, airport lounge access, and air miles.

5. **Category-Specific Cards**: Create specialized credit cards that cater to the most popular spending categories. For example, a 'Grocery Rewards Card' that offers extra points for grocery spending, or a 'Wellness Benefits Card' that partners with health and wellness businesses.

By implementing these data-driven strategies, Mitron Bank can tailor their new credit card offerings to the specific needs and behaviors of their customers, potentially increasing customer loyalty and market share.
